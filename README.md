### Tools and libraries
- Threejs 
- Vite + react
Helpful snips via Josh W Comeau:
- [useMousePosition](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-hooks/use-mouse-position/)
- [debounce](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/javascript/debounce/)
Cleanup
- husky
- eslint (and helpful shortlist for config)[https://cathalmacdonnacha.com/setting-up-eslint-prettier-in-vitejs], except make sure to use **.eslintrc.cjs** not .js, all else same.
- prettier
- pretty-quick

**Foibles to avoid**
- For whatever reason despite cloning an empty repo, I needed to `git init` again? husky installation was not working otherwise.
