### Tools and libraries

- Threejs
- Vite + react
  Helpful snips via Josh W Comeau:
- [useMousePosition](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-hooks/use-mouse-position/)
- [debounce](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/javascript/debounce/)
  Cleanup
- husky
- eslint (and helpful shortlist for config)[https://cathalmacdonnacha.com/setting-up-eslint-prettier-in-vitejs], except make sure to use **.eslintrc.cjs** not .js, all else same.
- prettier
- pretty-quick

**Foibles to avoid**

- For whatever reason despite cloning an empty repo, I needed to `git init` again? husky installation was not working otherwise.
- Someday soon (this 11-year-old warning)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5834014/lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-in-git-what-is-that-and-is-it-important] will hit me.
